Relatorio
=========

Relatorio is a templating library which provides a way to easily output several
kinds of files (odt, ods, png, svg, ...). Support for more filetypes can
be easily added by creating plugins for them.

Relatorio also provides a report repository allowing you to link python objects
and report together, find reports by mimetype/name/python object.

Note on PyCha
=============

Since the 0.4.0 release, pycha upstream author included most of our patches. So
it is not necessary anymore to use our friendly fork of the project.

For SVG support, you need PyCha 0.4.2 or later.
